# Flight-Anomaly-Detection  
Most of this project is about analysis and anomaly detection of flight data, such as altitude, speed, acceleration, fuel usage, etc.  
The way of detecting anomalies is first to learn and find high correlations between flight-data features over normal data, and using this information to detect anomalies in real-time data.  
As to this point of the project, the data analysis, learning and anomaly detection can be done only for already-made csv files.  
Additionally, there's included a client-server mini program, made to pracrice and simulate the use of such programs and to pracrice the use of threads in c++.
